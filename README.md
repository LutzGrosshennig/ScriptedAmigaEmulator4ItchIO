The Scripted Amiga Emulator for Itch.IO hosted Amiga Games/Tools.

WORK-IN-PROGRESS!

An Amiga Emulator in pure Javascript and HTML5 tailored to be used for Itch.IO hosted games/tools.

The orginal version of the emulator uses absolute paths which made it unfit to be used for Itch.io play-in-browser scenarios.
This fork has been modified to use relative paths instead which will work just fine in Itch.io.

Usage: Just add your .adf to the /db folder and reference it in the index.html (work-in-progress).
Zip all files and subdirectories in the folder that contains the index.html and upload it to Itch.io.

Note: I do not plan to make any changes / bug fixes to the emulator itself, this is just a modification so you can use this awesome emulator for your Itch.io builds.
